Static site generators (SSGs) have gained popularity in recent years as a way to create fast, secure, and easily maintainable websites. In this article, we will compare some popular static site generator software options, highlighting their features, use cases, and benefits.

## What is a Static Site Generator?

A static site generator is a tool that takes content, typically in the form of text files or data, and templates, and generates a complete website composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Choosing the Right SSG

The choice of the best static site generator depends on your project's requirements and your familiarity with the underlying technologies. Each SSG has its unique strengths, and you should consider factors like build speed, content sources, theming capabilities, and the size of the community when making your decision.

This site as pointed out [before](@/blog/zola-switch.md) uses the Zola SSG framework. Which was separately reviewed in [this post](@/blog/zola-review.md).

In conclusion, static site generators offer a compelling solution for web developers looking to build fast, secure, and easily maintainable websites. Whether you're a blogger, technical writer, or a developer working on a project, there's an SSG that can fit your needs. Choose the one that aligns with your project's goals, and you'll enjoy the benefits of static site generation.

Besides writing in markdown, with git commiting, gives a streamlined blogging experience, where you get to solely focus on the *content*. And on the other hand, this ecosystem of tools you use, makes you feel like a true hacker which adds to the experience and promotes delivering more content. Which for me personally has been a key motivating factor to maintain this blog.
