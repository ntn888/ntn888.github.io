Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts! Today, I'm taking a little detour from our usual DIY projects to dive into the exciting world of Linux gaming. Yeah, you heard me right – gaming on Linux is a thing, and it's not just for tech wizards in their secret lairs. Enter [Lutris](https://lutris.net/), the unsung hero of Linux gaming that has been quietly revolutionizing our gaming experiences over the past few years.

Now, if you're like me, you might have witnessed the evolution of tooling and development environments in the embedded world. Well, the same winds of change have been blowing in the gaming sphere, especially for our Linux buddies. In the last decade, the progress has been nothing short of remarkable.

Alright, let's get personal for a moment. Have you ever found yourself itching to play some of those AAA titles but felt a bit left out in the cold because, well, they weren't exactly Linux-friendly? Yeah, I've been there too. That's where Lutris steps in like a caped crusader, making Linux a serious contender in the gaming arena.

Lutris isn't just a gaming platform; it's a game-changer. It's like the DIY spirit we cherish in our embedded projects, but for gaming. It seamlessly integrates with different game stores, emulators, and even those beloved DRM-free titles. The best part? It's all about open source and open standards, aligning perfectly with our DIY ethos.

So, what's the deal with Lutris? Well, it's a game manager, sure, but it's also a treasure trove for tweaking and optimizing your gaming experience. It supports a plethora of games, including those Windows titles that never thought they'd see the light of a Linux desktop. With Lutris, you can manage game installations, customize settings, and even sync your game library across different platforms.

Lutris' companion suite - [Proton](https://www.protondb.com/) stands as a crucial element in the realm of Linux gaming compatibility, developed by Valve Corporation. It functions as a compatibility layer, enabling the seamless execution of Windows games on the Linux operating system. Leveraging the power of Vulkan and other technologies, Proton strives to overcome the historical barrier between Windows-exclusive titles and the Linux platform. Under constant development, it incorporates optimizations and improvements to enhance compatibility with a wide array of games. With its integration into the Steam client, Proton has significantly expanded the gaming library accessible to Linux users, contributing to the ongoing efforts to establish Linux as a viable gaming platform. Its serious approach to delivering compatibility aligns with the industry's shift towards broader inclusivity and accessibility in gaming.

From a technical standpoint, Lutris leverages compatibility layers like Wine and Proton to bridge the gap between Linux and Windows game libraries. It's like having a translator that enables games written for one platform to speak the language of another. This technical wizardry is crucial for expanding the gaming catalog on Linux.

Now, let's address the elephant in the room – running pirated games on Linux. In my experience Lutris does a better work of running these than the native Windows OS! Lutris has a handy *Install from EXE* option that's handy just for this case. You just have to mount the download (if required) and point Lutris to the Setup executable. Easy! I use a separately partitioned instance of PoPOS and have lutris installed on it for my gaming needs. This is a way to declutter from my main PoPOS install for my dev environment needs. As installing games tend to be time intensive, I can leave the gaming partition alone when I upgrade/reinstall the workstation one.

In conclusion, the past 10 years have seen remarkable strides in the tooling and development environments for Linux gaming. Lutris stands out as a beacon of progress, making gaming on our favorite open-source Linux platform a delightful experience. As we look to the future, the horizon seems bright, with continued advancements and a growing community of passionate Linux gamers.

So, fellow enthusiasts, let's raise our DIY soldering irons in celebration of Lutris and the exciting times ahead for Linux gaming.
