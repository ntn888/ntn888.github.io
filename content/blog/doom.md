I've always been shuffling around `neovim`, `emacs`, `vscode`. This writeup will explain how I've settled on the use of emacs. DOOM Emacs specifically.

It's github page is accessible [DOOM Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs); documentation [here](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/index.org) and installation for all platform are accessible [here](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/getting_started.org).

DOOM Emacs is a batteries included edition of emacs. Together with which-key and easy language enable features (layers), it has a very intuitive experience which is ideal for the beginner (to command line editior altogether!) I think DOOM's got a clean modern funky interface too.

The one thing it's lacking is a newbie friendly guide/intro to using it. In contrast to my opinion; the developers' hold that DOOM is for an experienced emacs user. I beg to differ as stated above.

To help with this user onboarding issue, when I've tried to pick up usage, I've scoured the internet to put together a single sheet[^1] summarising all the essential commands. Accessible [here](/img/doom-cmds.pdf).

Let me know down what's you favourite newbie friendly emacs edition is?

[^1]: That's all the familiarity it requires. That's how intuitive it is!
