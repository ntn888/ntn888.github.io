The SSD1306 128x64 oled display is a popular I/O device that can be added to any project for example to provide some visual diagnostics. It comes in two main variaties; the I2C and the SPI version. We'll be using the I2C one.

Fortunately the SDK has already the implementation for the lvgl graphics library (provides APIs to simplify access to the display), so we just need to write the I2C protocol driver for oled.
