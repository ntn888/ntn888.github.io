![Pico 4M versio](/img/4MB_Pico.jpg)

I recently tried out the PICO 4MB version sold here: [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003928558306](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003928558306). A cheaper alternative to the official version but with the larger flash.

Specifically called "Lite Black" by the seller, it has a similar layout to the original with the single LED at port-25.

Considering it's an Cortex-M chipset (M0+) it will be programmed by a ST-LINK (SWD) debugger probe. The PI Pico comes with it's own programming environment / SDK for building application in C/C++.

This 4MB variant at it's given price is an excellent alternative to the classic bluepill which lacks flash for any complex applications. And will be a drop in replacement for any bluepill suitable projects in future.
