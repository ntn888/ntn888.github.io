As revealed in the previous [post](@/blog/zola-switch.md) this site is now migrated into the Zola SSG management system. Zola is based on rust and boasts performance. What really caught my eye though is the numerous readymade *light-weight* themes available for it. Which is a refreshing change from the heavy theme this site used previously in the Jekyll framework.

Some of it's other pros are:

- Single binary for all functionality

- Brings the performance advantages of Rust.

- Flexible customizations options; easily customize the website as required

Cons:

- Limited theme options; Zola has a limited number of pre-built themes available. On the other hand most of the options here are lightweight (which is my preference).

- Zola is known to have a steeper learning curve, but in my experience it is on par with other SSGs such as Jekyll.

Many people now prefer Zola for thier SSG blog; and it's a current trend to migrate to it.. Read more about Zola on their website: [https://www.getzola.org/](https://www.getzola.org/). Various deployment methods are discussed on [https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/overview/](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/overview/).
