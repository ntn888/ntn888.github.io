This blog site has now switched to the Zola static site generator framework. Previously it was based on Jekyll (the default github pages framework). Zola is based on Rust and is more lightweight. The look of the new site is also more lightweight.

This article will also serve as a trigger for testing on-push deployment and test the auto site generation!

In other news I'm looking to learning a web development framework. Specifically the LAMP stack... I'll log any update here if notable.
