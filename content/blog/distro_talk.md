# Ubuntu

I've used Ubuntu for the longest time. I've used it during my formidable learning years, from 2008 to 2018. Whew that was a decade, just thinking about it! I mostly like it. One of the key differentiating factors among distros is their package management. And APT feels robust.

# Pop-OS

My usual go-to distro currently. Been using it since circa 2020. Builds on top of Ubuntu, so you get the niceties of the large user base! Feels like a community distro as opposed to Ubuntu (although I believe it's also a corporate driven one). But it doesn't force snaps down your throat like Ubuntu.

# Debian

The Mother of all distros! Haha! In seriousness, it's the base distro for Ubuntu. And a well know rock-solid one. I generally use it in all my VPS servers whenever I can.

# CentOS

Used to be the most popular server distro until Redhat pulled the cord!

# Fedora

This was my first Linux distro that I started with and briefly used back in 2007. I believe it was called Fedora Core back then. Then I briefly used in 2018/19. During this time, I saw that the package manager was not as stable as Debian's APT, and started giving out errors after a few months of tinkering/use.

I'm currently trialling out daily driving Fedora 39, the latest version as of January 2024. I'm currently learning Linux Kernel module programming, as this will tell how good a developer's distro Fedora is!

# Overall Reflection

I've completely stopped using Windows as my OS back in 2010 and the experience has been a liberating one. One of my favourite aspects about Linux is its hardware compatibility. It sails through on older hardware. Which makes it possible to have setups like [these](@/blog/dev_station.md).

Although linux powers majority of the servers; it's heavily lacking in the desktop market-share. Owing to only about 2% usage! Enthusiasts speak about the *Year of the Linux desktop*. But as much as I wish it were, I don't see it happening anytime soon.
